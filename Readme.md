# Test Nested Plugin

This module is used to test Bud's plugin system. It's depended on by [bud-test-plugin](https://github.com/livebud/bud-test-plugin).

The files in this repository do not matter. They are just used as fixtures in Bud's test suite.

If you're making changes to existing files, double-check that you aren't breaking tests in https://github.com/livebud/bud.
